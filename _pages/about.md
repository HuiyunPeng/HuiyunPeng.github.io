Hi, I'm Huiyun Peng!
I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, advised by Dr. James C. Davis in the Duality Lab.

## Education

**Purdue University**, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA (August 2024 - May 2029)
- Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
- GPA: 3.94/4.0

**Mount Holyoke College**, South Hadley, MA, USA (August 2018 - May 2022)
- B.A. in Computer Science, Minor in Philosophy
- *magna cum laude*
- GPA: 3.92/4.0

## Research

My research primarily focuses on AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE), exploring how artificial intelligence can improve the development, optimization, and maintenance of complex software systems. I am also interested in software security and responsible AI.

Currently, I am developing novel approaches to automate high-performance, energy-efficient software development by leveraging and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze, generate, and optimize code.

### Research Experience

**Purdue Duality Lab** - Graduate Research Assistant (July 2024 - Present)
- Designed a multi-agent pipeline that automatically optimizes software systems by integrating static analysis insights with architecture-level abstractions
- Conceptualized a reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) method that enables multi-objective code optimization
- Developed an LLM-based framework for automatically optimizing large-scale real-world software systems for performance and energy efficiency
- Evaluated the ZTD JAVA tool in mitigating software supply chain vulnerabilities

**Harvard Forest, Harvard University** - Research Assistant (January 2020 - July 2020)
- Under the supervision of Dr. Barbara Staudt Lerner
- Designed and implemented an automated Python tool to capture and analyze data provenance
- Converted SQL data into JSON to enable End-to-End provenance workflow integration

## Professional Experience

**Software Engineer II** - Mastercard Data & Services, Arlington, VA (June 2022 - June 2024)
- Led the design, development, testing, and rollout of new internal library APIs
- Analyzed, developed, and rolled out C# enhancements to improve reliability and performance
- Designed and built front-end infrastructure in TypeScript using React framework
