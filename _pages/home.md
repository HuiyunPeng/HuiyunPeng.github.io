Hi, I'm Huiyun!
I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, advised by Dr. James C. Davis.
Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Software Engineer II at Mastercard Data & Services. 
I received my B.A. in Computer Science from Mount Holyoke College in 2022.

# Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on **AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)**, exploring how artificial intelligence can improve the development, optimization, and maintenance of complex software systems. I am also interested in software security and responsible AI.

Currently, I am developing novel approaches to automate high-performance, energy-efficient software development by leveraging and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze, generate, and optimize code.
