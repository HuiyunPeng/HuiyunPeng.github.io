# Welcome!

Hi, I'm Huiyun Peng!
I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, advised by Dr. James C. Davis at the Duality Lab.

## Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on **AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)**, exploring how artificial intelligence can improve the development, optimization, and maintenance of complex software systems. I am also interested in software security and responsible AI.

Currently, I am developing novel approaches to automate high-performance, energy-efficient software development by leveraging and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze, generate, and optimize code.

## Background

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a Software Engineer II at Mastercard Data & Services, where I led the design and development of internal APIs and built front-end infrastructure using TypeScript and React. I received my B.A. in Computer Science (magna cum laude) from Mount Holyoke College in 2022.
